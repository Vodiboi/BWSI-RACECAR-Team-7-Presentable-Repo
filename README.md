# BWSI-RACECAR-Team-7-Presentable-Repo
The repository for the organized code of RACECAR Team 7. At BWSI RACECAR, teams compete in the Quest Log, getting their cars to perform certain tasks such as Cone Slalom, Line Following, Car Following (Conga Line), Sign Detection, and Wall Following, in order to purchase upgrades to their cars. This culminates in a Time Trial around the grand prix circuit, and a 14 car race on it.   
This repository contains most of our code for the Quest Log, Time Trials, and Grand Prix.  

## Main Features:

- Cone Slalom  
- Line Following  
- Wall Following  
- Conga Line


The object detection code was omitted from this repository, as while we were able to perform object detection, we never managed to get driving with object detection properly working (due to running the model slowing down the refresh rate of the car's update loop, making the car "more laggy").
