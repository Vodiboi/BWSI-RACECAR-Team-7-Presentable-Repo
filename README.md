# BWSI-RACECAR-Team-7-Presentable-Repo
Not the repo will all code, just the organized one

## Main Features:

- Cone Slalom  
- Line Following  
- Wall Following  
- Conga Line


The object detection code was omitted from this repository, as while we were able to perform object detection, we never managed to get driving with object detection properly working (due to running the model slowing down the refresh rate of the car's update loop, making the car "more laggy").
